# Rotating Position

A MakeCode extension for Minecraft that lets you rotate positions in 3D space.

> [日本語版はこちら / Japanese version](README_ja.md)

## What does this do?

This extension adds a block that rotates any position around a center point. Perfect for:
- Creating tilted buildings and structures
- Building complex geometric patterns

## How to use

After adding the extension, you'll find a new block in the **Positions** category:

**"Rotation target position [position] Origin [position] Axis [X/Y/Z] Angle [0-360]"**

### What each part means:

- **Rotation target position**: The point you want to rotate
- **Origin**: The center point to rotate around
- **Axis**: Which direction to rotate (X, Y, or Z)
- **Angle**: How many degrees to rotate (0-360)

This is great for making things spin around a center point!
